**The Crop Tool for Quality Assurance of BMP Datasets**

**Script:** FL_Crop_BMP_QA_single_dataset.Rmd

**Date:** May. 5, 2025

**Introduction**

A major issue in preparing any dataset for subsequent use is whether the
data meet the expectations of users in terms of accuracy, completeness,
documentation, and other criteria. The Crop BMP tool for quality assurance
(QA) conducts a series of tests on a dataset. These tests may usefully
be run multiple times while completing a dataset to avoid problems
becoming harder to resolve as more data are entered. This feature of
assessing quality during the creation process distinguishes “quality
assurance” from the more common term “quality control”, which refers to
assessing the quality of a finished product.

The R script FL_Crop_BMP_QA_single_dataset reviews Crop BMP datasets according to
what we term the "four C's", whereby a dataset is:

1. **Correct**: The values are accurate within the expected range of
   measurement error. We emphasize that the main error-checking should
   be done as a part of the normal data management pipeline prior to
   loading into the Crop BMP template.

2. **Complete**: The dataset is complete enough to enable further
   analyses without researchers having to seek guidance on how the crop
   was grown, weather conditions, etc.

3. **Coherent**: Identifiers (keys) that link data across sheets are
   used consistently.

4. **Compatible**: By linking the Crop BMP terminology to the ICASA
   standards, we expect that datasets can be used with a wide range of
   tools including artificial intelligence, machine learning and either
   simulation or statistical models.

The script produces a report as a PDF file. The output alternates
between explanatory text to guide interpretation and blocks of output from R. The script does **not** modify the target Crop BMP dataset.

**Procedure for Running the Script**

The basic procedure for using the script is outlined below. We assume
that the user is familiar with basic operation of the R language, use of
RStudio, and understands how Crop BMP datasets are organized.

1. Download the script ‘FL_Crop_BMP_QA_single_dataset’ to a folder of your
   choice.

2. Copy the Crop BMP dataset file to the same folder or a subfolder such as 'Data'.

3. Open the R script ‘FL_Crop_BMP_QA_single_dataset’ in RStudio.

4. If not done previously, install the packages that RStudio detects
   are required. These might include: openxlsx2, knitr, ggplot2, maps,
   mapdata, and reshape2.

5. In the script, edit the variable ‘data_set_name’ to contain the name
   of the Crop BMP dataset to be assessed. Similarly, edit the file path
   as needed. These should be the only modification to the R script.

6. Run the script from RStudio by entering ‘alt-ctrl-r’ or navigating
   through the menu bar to Code -\> Run Region -\> Run All.

7. The script should run, outputting a few lines of information to
   assist possible de-bugging.

8. Upon completion, execute the ‘Knit’ command, which should appear as
   a button on the Source pane (upper left) of RStudio.

9. The ‘Render” tab should become active and will display a few
   processing steps as the document is converted to a PDF titled
   ‘FL_Crop_BMP_QA_single_dataset.pdf’.

10. View the PDF document, which should appear in the same folder as the script.

This completes the process for generating a QA report for an Crop BMP
dataset.

**Troubleshooting**

One possible source of problems is if individual worksheets are
completely empty. We have attempted to limit the errors that lack of
data will generate, but it is difficult to know if all cases are
covered.

The most likely source of small errors is mismatches among worksheet
names, individual variable names, and values for identifiers. This includes using non-standard characters in variable names (e.g. "?") and introducing new variables in unexpected locations such as among identifiers (e.g., immedaitely after "Experiment ID").
